        <h1>Mosaics, Trains, and Acoustics with the London Underground</h1>
        <p>Your Mosaics, Trains, and Acoustics adventure starts with a scenic trip through the London Underground. The London Underground runs throughout the city with many stations for easy travel, with some of the most beautiful stations being King's Cross, Waterloo, and Canary Wharf. After traveling through the city center, many lines reach out to the outskirts of the city.</p>
        <h2>What to Bring</h2>
        <p>While there is no official guide for this kind of tour, we recommend you bring a map and keep a sharp eye out on the signage around the London Underground as it is very easy to get lost on the twisting tunnels. There are lots of shops in the bigger stations so if you're willing to support the local and corporate economy, bring along some pounds</p>
